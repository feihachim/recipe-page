            Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake
            recipe! Paired with a buttery graham cracker crust, no one can deny
            its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water bath.

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat
                oven to 350°F (177°C).
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Make the crust:</span> Using a food processor, pulse the
                graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in
                sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it
                all together in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy.
                Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a
                9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan
                first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust
                down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and
                place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil
                will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow
                crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Make the filling:</span> Using a handheld or stand mixer
                fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and
                granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl
                until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the
                sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until
                fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time,
                beating after each addition until just blended. After the final
                egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help
                prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools,
                avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Prepare the simple water bath (see note)</span> Boil a pot
                of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the
                water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle
                of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil
                around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of
                the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an
                even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan.
                Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the
                oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then
                pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost
                set. When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly
                wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open
                the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in
                the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven
                and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room
                temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4
                hours or overnight.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the
                springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife,
                cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife
                clean and dip into warm water between each slice.
              </li>
              <li>
                Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover
                cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
              </li>
